            <h3>The Beginning</h3>
            <p>My journey into tech started with law. My love for Software Patent Protection (IP) Law led me to code. I gave myself the task of learning Ruby to showcase my interest in IP. The idea of bringing an idea to life was magical.</p>

          <div className="story-card">
            <div className="story-icon">üöÄ</div>
            <h3>Growing</h3>
            <p> I dove deep into Codecademy and FreeCodeCamp, each lesson taught me something new. Just three weeks into learning I caught wind of Makers & software apprenticeships and felt there was no harm in applying. Fast forward 2 years later I had completed my apprenticeship and beginning my junior role. </p>

            <h3>Today</h3>
            <p>Now I'm focused on creating user-centered applications that make a real difference. I believe, just like law, you are tasked with finding a solution to a problem a stakeholder cannot solve themselves. Nothing is more rewarding than to deliver this solution.</p>

                <h3>The Spark ‚ö°</h3>
                <p>It actually began in secondary school - didn't do Computing GCSE because it was just boys - felt discouraged.</p>
                <p>Fast forward 6 years, I felt uninspired trying to get into law. I worked in the courts, I liked the exposure but felt like potentially law wasn't best suited for me. I had seen a few TikToks about coding and saved them but had no real desire to follow back on it.</p>
                <p>I decided after my third failed interview that I would try to showcase my passion for IP. After brainstorming I decided let me learn a little HTML and CSS.</p>
                <p>I started on FreeCodeCamp and loved the little lessons, I got my certificate in 2 weeks.</p>
                <p>Mentioned to a friend and they mentioned the Makers' pathway </p>
                <p>I remember dismissing it, assuming it may be another hobby that goes nowhere. But with a little convinving I thought what do I have to lose by applying?</p>
                <p>Then they got back to me with so much enthusiasm and I was shocked at their faith in me. After all those failed interviews it felt gratifying. Small part of me had always doubted law and a bigger part of me felt like I had just found something that I could actually be good at.</p>

                <p>Makers kept in close contact with me and taught me to learn Ruby and share my Codecademy profile</p>
                <p>Makers asked for my CV and were proactive in passing me through the stages</p>
                <p>From my first appplication to my first interview via Makers, it was about 2 months. It all happened quickly and everything in me felt like I was on the right path - maybe Law was so difficult and I felt uninspired because it wasn't for me!</p>
                <p>With my first interview via Makers, I got the job!</p>
